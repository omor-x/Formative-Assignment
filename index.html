            <h2><u>What is Climate Change?</u></h2>
            <p>Climate change is a shift in the average weather conditions in a place over many years. Due to the increase in fossil fuel combustion, the concentration of greenhouse gases like CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing rapidly. There are many consequences as a result of climate change like: Global temperature rising, the Ocean warming, Sea level rising and more which will be mentioned on this page.</p>

            <h3>Global temperature rising</h3>
            <a href="https://www.co2.earth/global-warming-update" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.co2.earth/images/graphs-charts/2020-11_global_temperature-plot_columbiaU-hansen-sato_2020-12-14.png" width="320" height="240" alt="Heat records" /></a>

            <ul>
                <li>The Earth’s temperature has risen about 1.18 degrees Celsius since the 1800s, due to increases in carbon emissions into the atmosphere. 0.08° C per decade to be exact.</li>
                <li>Due to the start of the industrial revolution and fuel being used more commonly for vehicles and transportation for example.</li>
                <li>The majority of the warming took place within the past 40 years, in fact the most recent years were recorded as the hottest. 2020 was recorded as the second hottest year on record as the surface temperatures was almost 1 degree Celsius warmer than the 20th century average and 1.19 degrees Celsius warmer than before the industrial period. A new high temperature record was set on average every 13.5 years between the years 1900 and 1980s whereas a new record was set every 3 years between the years 1981-2019.</li>
                <li>Satellite observations reveal that in the northern hemisphere, snow is melting earlier and over the past 50 years, snow cover has decreased.</li>

            <h3>Warming Oceans</h3>

            <h5>Source - The Economist</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The ocean absorbs a lot of heat due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the years mainly due to the consumption of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gases.</li>
                <li>A lot of the increased heat has been absorbed by the oceans resulting in the top 100 metres showing signs of warming of more than 0.33 degrees Celsius since 1969.</li>
                <li>90% of additional energy is stored in the ocean, in fact the IPCC revealed that in 2013 the ocean had absorbed 93% of the excess heat produced by greenhouse gases since the 1970s.</li>
                <li>The distribution of excess heat in the ocean is being concentrated in the southern hemisphere as it isn’t uniform which is resulting in the melting of the Antarctic ice shelves.</li>
                <li>Ocean warming leads to a reduction of the oxygen dissolved in the water and the sea level rising due to ice melting and sea water expanding as a result of the additional heat being absorbed. Ocean acidification has become an issue as the pH of ocean is lowering due to the increased concentration of carbon dioxide which can damage ecosystems and marine species.</li>

            <h5>Source - Happy Mag</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between the years 1993 and 2019 and Antarctica lost around 148 billion tons each year. This led to the ice sheets in the respective areas decreasing in mass. The total amount of ice lost in 1992-2018 was enough to raise the global sea level average by nearly 2 cm.</li>
                <li>The thickness and extent of the sea ice in the North Pole/Arctic is quickly reduced over the past several decades.</li>

            <h5>Source - Ocean (Find your Blue)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Since the beginning of the Industrial period, the ocean’s surface has increased in acidity by nearly 30% due to the ocean absorbing the excess co2 being emitted by people. 20-30% of total CO2 emissions has been absorbed by the ocean.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><u>How it can be fixed?</u></h3>
            <p>Limiting greenhouse gases emissions by reducing the amount of fossil fuel being consumed by switching to alternative methods like green energy or finding other methods to travel. Saving water reduces the amount of pollution by carbon as it takes a lot of energy to pump, treat and even heat up the water. Eating less meat and consuming all the food you buy is important as it requires energy to raise the animals and grow the food as well as the process of getting it to markets.<br><br>Protecting marine and coastal ecosystems by conserving and protecting marine habitats will help regulate human activity in those areas and reduce the amount of harm towards wildlife and ecosystems
                Increasing scientific research will make sure governments can invest in scientific research to monitor the ocean and observe the effect on it.<br><br>Having more accurate data allows for humans to implement sufficient plans to preserve and reduce the harm being done.</p>
